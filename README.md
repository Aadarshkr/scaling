# scaling
Scaling alters size of a system. In the scaling process, we either compress or expand the system to meet the expected needs. The sxaling operation can be achieved by adding resources to meet the smaller expectio in the current system, or by adding a new system in the existion one or both.
Scalability is being able to handle more reques and both vertical and horizontal scaling handle these request differently. Horizontal scaling has multiple serverrs that receive the request but vertical scaling has only one big server that handles them. 
### Scaling can be categoriesd into two types. 
1. Vertical Scaling
2. Horizontal Scaling

* Vertical Scaling - When new resources are added in the existing system to meet the expectation, it is known as vertical scaling. Consider a rack of servers and resources that compriof the existing system. 

* Horizontal Scaling - When new server racks are added in the existion system to meet the higer expectation, it is known as horizontal scaling.
